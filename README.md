**Product Requirements**

2. **Performance:** The application should perform efficiently and reliably: it should be free of detrimental errors/bugs and should perform with reasonable efficiency.
3. **Accessibility:** EduQuest should implement at the very least barebones accessibility features throughout the application (alt text, captioning, etc.) and should push to try and implement other desired features (dyslexia font conversion, site-alterable font size, dark mode, etc.) 
4. **Usability:** EduQuest should be responsive on all devices (Mobile and PC). Users should be able to use the application across these platforms without issue.

### Nice to have
- Thought for the live question groups should we have to where students in groups can also submit essay questions as groups? (similar to how canvas groups have it where if one person submits then they all submit?) -> could do it internally treating each student group as an entity
